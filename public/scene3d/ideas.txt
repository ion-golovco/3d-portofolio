 -programing
 -video editing 
 -game dev
 -real life stuff implication
Each planet orbits around a sun which will pe the contact page
When clicking on a planet, or sun you will get sent to a page using react router
the planets will have the same color as the page background
they will have writeen on them the name or will use a react component that changes when its close to a different planet
There will be little moons orbiting the planets for the important projects specific to the planet

For mobile there will be a different page, with only react and will just send you to the pages that were the planets.
The ui will have only basic info and will dissaper once you start scorlling
For the planets, they can have vibrant colors and could also add shaders and other stuff

the other pages will not have 3d elements for now.
